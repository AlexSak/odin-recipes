Odin - Recipes Project

My first project during the Odin Project. It's about 3 Greek recipes.

The main skills taught by the project so far are:
- Basic commands for the Bash command line.
- Basic Git and Github usage.
- Basic HTML (basic HTML boilerplate, paragraphs, headings, lists, links and images).
